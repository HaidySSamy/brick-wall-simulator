# brick-wall-simulator
For this assignment, we'd like you to implement a small interactive program to simulate and visualize the build plan for a masonry wall, one brick at the time. On top of the visualization, weâ€™d want you to come up with an efficient algorithm to calculate a build order that optimizes for total time spent building.
